# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is a advent calendar of coding challenges that can be solved in any programming language.
The challenges are given in the form of an input that is randomly generated for every user and then instructions of what to extract form the input.


I am currently working on solving these challenges and will add my sollutions to this repository as I solve them.

| Day | Breif descrption of solution   |
| --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Array sorting and comparison   |
| 2   | Array minipulation to determine if the array is in order and has steps between 1 and 3|
| 3   | Used java.util.regex library to search for patterns in the input |
| 4   | 2D array traversal and comparison |
