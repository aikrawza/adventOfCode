# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is a advent calendar of coding challenges that can be solved in any programming language.
The challenges are given in the form of an input that is randomly generated for every user and then instructions of what to extract form the input. Each challenge has two parts, the frist part requires you to get the input in some form of data structure that can be manipulated to find the sollution to the challege, then to find the sollution. The second part builds upon the first part, and depending on the day requires anything from changing a line or two in an if statement to designing a completely new sollution starting from where the input is read in.


I am currently working on solving these challenges and will add my sollutions to this repository as I solve them.

| Day | Breif descrption of solution   |
| --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Array sorting and comparison   |
| 2   | Array minipulation to determine if the array is in order and has steps between 1 and 3|
| 3   | Used java.util.regex library to search for patterns in the input |
| 4   | 2D array traversal and comparison |
| 5   | Creation of a map data structure to hold a key and multiple values associated with the key |
